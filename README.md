# Epic Cookie Mod

This is a non-cheating Mod for Cookie Clicker. It can assist in the small stuff to help during the idle parts of the game, so your cookie empire continues to grow while you work/sleep/play, etc.

If you find any features in this mod that are buggy, or seem to be too cheaty, please feel free to leave me some feedback.

## Features

### More Visible Stats

This shows you total number of cookies including those from Wrinkler multiplication. Also shows you the Prestige level you would be at once all your Wrinklers are popped.

### Cookie Shield

This was the first mod I created and is what began my journey into creating Epic Cookie. It raises a shield over the big cookie when Shimmering Veil is active, to prevent any accidental clicks.

### Auto Upgrade Purchasing

This feature will auto-buy any upgrades you can afford

### Auto Building Purchasing

This feature will auto-buy buildings you can afford, and can even keep them in neat intervals of a number you choose (10, 100, etc)

### Auto Dragon Levelling

This feature will auto buy dragon levels for you

To-do: Auto populate the Dragon Auras

### Auto Santa Levelling

This feature will auto buy santa levels for you

### Drop Egg Notification

This will give you more information on possible Egg Drops you could have received.

### Wrinkler Popper

[incomplete] This feature of EpicCookie will give you the option to pop all wrinklers with one click, with the option of leaving any shiny wrinklers alone.

### Additional functions

Additional useful functions are included in the EpicCookie mod. These can be called with `epicCookie.functions.{functionName}()`

 - `cookiesFromWrinklers()`: The number of cookies you will have if you pop all wrinklers now
 - `cookiesToSpendWithWrinklers()`: This addes the result from `cookiesFromWrinklers()` to the current number of cookies you have
 - `prestigeWithWrinklers()`: The amount of prestige you will have after popping all wrinklers
